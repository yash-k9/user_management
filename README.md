# User-Management
User management system built with Flutter for Native Android.

## Features
1. User Listing - Flutter screen displays a list of users fetched from native db
2. User Registration - Native User registration form which saves data to native db
3. User Deletion - Native user deletion functionality

The communication between Flutter and native Android code is done using Method Channels and Event Channels.
Further improvements can be made by incorporating DI, improving gradle structure, linting and adding test cases.
